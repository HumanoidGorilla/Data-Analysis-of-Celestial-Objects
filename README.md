This a small ongoing project that is meant to showcase the various relationships I was able to find between the variables relating to celestial objects (Ex: Luminosity, Mass, Radius, Rotational Velocity, etc.) I plan on expanding this onto galaxy systems as well as various other celestial objects that I find fascinating. I'll make sure to bring in reliable data sets along with utilizing various different programs to fact check all the work I do!

This will be done on mostly python as that is the language I am trying to learn at the moment, I may expand to things such as MATLAB in the future but I want to focus on the mastery of one particular language first. I will be posting the data sets I am using in case anyone wants to fact check my results or want to critique my coding.

I plan on adding various different techniques such as ML, spectroscopy, and such into this project as well when I become proficient in their tools, but for now I will stick to the basics and focus on utilizing what I know and becoming comfortable with that first.

Each seperate research question will have three different questions that I hope to add, they are:
- Can we visualize the data? (Visualization)
- Is there a relationship between the variables? (Pattern)
- What relationship do the variables have? (Relationship)
- What equation(s) can we create that matches the relationship between the two variables? (Equation)
I will attempt to answer each of these in my project, with the last question being the most difficult one that I seek to answer

These are the questions that I hope I can answer eventually:

|Project|Description|Visual Data|Pattern|Relationship|Equation|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|[Relationship between Star Luminosity and Mass](https://github.com/HumanoidGorilla/Data-Analysis-of-Celestial-Objects/blob/main/Relationship_between_Star_Luminosity_and_Mass.ipynb)| The goal is to find a relationship between luminosity and mass with the hypothesis that the increased mass will increase the amount of fusion reactions occuring, causing an increase in luminosity.| ✓ | ✓ | |
|Galaxy Mass and Rotational Velocity| The goal is to see if there is a relationship between a galaxies mass and rotational velocity. This is being done due to a discovery I found while researching papers that "super-galaxies" apparently rotate faster than our own.| | | | |
|Differences in mass between dwarf planets and planetoid|This one is meant to be a small investigation between planetoids and dwarf planets to see the true scale of these celestial bodies, this one wont be as thorough or code heavy as the others but I want to create unique visual data with this one| | | |I do not plan on adding an equation for this one|
